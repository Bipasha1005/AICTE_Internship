# üß† Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

> Internship Project under AICTE's Virtual Internship Program focused on applying deep learning and machine learning concepts for human pose detection from images and video frames.

## üìå Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **AICTE Machine Learning Internship**, where the primary objective was to build an ML model capable of detecting and estimating human body keypoints in real-time.

Human pose estimation refers to the process of detecting human joints (keypoints) such as elbows, knees, shoulders, etc., from images or video ‚Äî which has critical applications in healthcare, sports analysis, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Role & Contribution

As an intern, I was actively involved in:

- Understanding the theoretical background of pose estimation
- Implementing models using **OpenPose** and **MediaPipe**
- Preprocessing image datasets for training and inference
- Annotating keypoints and evaluating model accuracy
- Deploying the model for real-time pose detection using webcam input

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **MediaPipe**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**


## üîç Key Features

- Real-time pose detection from webcam/video
- Visualization of 18 keypoints with skeleton overlay
- Integration with **MediaPipe Pose** and **OpenPose** for accuracy comparison
- Heatmap generation for joint probability analysis
- Option to track multiple persons

## üìà Results & Visualizations

- Achieved real-time performance of ~20 FPS on CPU using MediaPipe
- Successfully detected keypoints with ~85% accuracy on sample datasets
- Visualized joint connections with labeled skeleton overlays

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

- Developed a strong understanding of CNNs and keypoint detection models
- Gained practical skills in image processing and ML model deployment
- Improved ability to visualize and evaluate pose estimation outputs
- Hands-on experience with real-time video processing using OpenCV
